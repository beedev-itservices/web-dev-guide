### Working Repository
This guide will be a continuoulsy working directory of tips and tricks that we have learned in our time as Web Developers

1. Each member contributes to the project using their own branches.  Over time each members contrubutions will be added to the main files which will become a working site (with notations to who contributed)

### Teams Members
1. Fork Repository to your personal acct if you would like
2. Clone to local host and create a branch with your username.
3. Please be sure to commit and push to your branch only
4. Recommend createing a named folder in your branch to upload your working documents too so that when it comes time to combining it is easier to keep track.
5. How you create your parts is up to you....html or txt.
