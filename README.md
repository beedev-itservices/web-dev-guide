### Working Repository
This guide will be a continuoulsy working directory of tips and tricks that we have learned in our time as Web Developers

1. Each member contributes to the project using their own branches.  Over time each members contrubutions will be added to the main files which will become a working site (with notations to who contributed)

### Teams Members
1. Fork Repository to your personal acct if you would like
2. Clone to local host and create a branch with your username.
3. Please be sure to commit and push to your branch only
4. Recommend createing a named folder in your branch to upload your working documents too so that when it comes time to combining it is easier to keep track.
5. How you create your parts is up to you....html or txt.
6. Remember to save and commit often.  Push to your branch as often as you want.


## Website folder
This contains all the documents for the website portion.  All members are welcome to contribute as long as it is to their own branch.  The files contained will be empty to start.  

1. A slack workspace is set up to discuss project details. Find link below


 ## Team-docs folder
 This folder is where each team member saves their documents of tips and tricks.

 1. How you save your documents is up to you.  As html or txt is fine
